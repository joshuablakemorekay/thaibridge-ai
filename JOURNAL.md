# Build Journal — Thai Language & Culture Learning App

This is the honest record of building my **first web app** — a Thai language and culture learning site — mostly with AI help, as a complete beginner. It's a learning project and a portfolio piece, not a finished product. I've kept the wins and the mistakes in, because the mistakes are where I actually learned.

## March–April 2026 — Researching whether it's worth building

Before building more, I stopped to research the market: who the competitors are, how big the UK audience is, what people would pay, and whether there's a real gap.

**What I learned:** the gap is real — the big apps don't teach Thai at all, and none combine Thai with Buddhist culture. I also learned to *ground* research in real sources and to **check which tools actually ran** — I'd named a web-scraping tool and later found it never fired. (The prompts behind this research are saved in the `/prompts` folder.)

## February 2026 — Version control and a proper workflow

I set up Git (version control — a way to save snapshots of the project) and connected it to GitHub (online backup) one step at a time. Then I started using Claude Code (an AI that edits files in the project directly) for real tasks:

- Built a **user registration system** with a database and a signup form.
- Fixed a bug where empty forms could be submitted (used two safety layers — a browser check and a JavaScript check).
- Cleaned up the signup code and added **32 automatic tests** for the points/levels logic.
- Did a code review and fixed the important issues — including returning the correct error codes and stopping a database error from crashing the app.

**What I learned:** once Git was set up, I could make big changes — and let an AI make them — **without fear, because I could always roll back**. I also learned to give the AI small, specific jobs and review every change before accepting it. When Claude Code ran out of credits, I made two of the fixes by hand and understood what they did — which felt like a turning point.

## February 2026 — Adding Pra Kru Bob's Buddhist writings

I added two of Pra Kru Bob's Buddhist essays as new pages, keeping the wording faithful to the originals.

**What I learned:** my first attempt quietly dropped paragraphs. **Faithful means faithful** — I had to insist on the complete text and check it against the source rather than trust a summary.

## December 2025 — Adding the AI tutor

I connected the app to the Claude API (a way for the app to talk to the AI) to build an in-app tutor with several modes — conversation, grammar help, quizzes, culture, and Buddhism.

**What I learned:** this was the hardest setup. Python wasn't installed; then packages weren't installed; then my secret key vanished because I'd only set it for one terminal session; then it broke because I'd **forgotten the quote marks** around the key in Python. It finally worked once I loaded the key right at the top of the file. Biggest lesson: **don't trust "it works" — including from an AI.** I had to correct the claim that the chat worked when it didn't, and test it myself.

## December 2025 — The romanization display problem

Thai romanization uses accent marks, and one vowel combination (`ɔ̌ɔ`) kept rendering with mismatched letters. I tried several fixes — spacing, fonts, rendering tricks — and most didn't fully work.

**What I learned:** some problems are genuinely deeper than they look (this one is about how computers combine accent characters). I learned **when to stop polishing and pick a pragmatic workaround** rather than chase perfection.

## November 2025 — Building the first version (and debugging it)

I built the first working version: the Flask backend, the Thai alphabet and vocabulary content, lessons, a points-and-levels system, and the page styling.

**What I learned:** most of my early errors weren't broken code — they were **files in the wrong place**. "Template not found" meant a page wasn't in the folder Flask looks in. "name 'app' is not defined" meant I'd tried to *run* a file that was only meant to be *imported* into the main app. And two pages sharing the same web address crashed it. **Reading the error message** usually told me exactly what was wrong.

## November 2025 — Planning the app

I planned the app using a describe-then-check method: I told the AI exactly what I wanted (the format, the approach, how to work with me), then judged what came back and refined it.

**What I learned:** my plan ballooned into a huge, expensive vision. The real progress came from **cutting it down to a small, working version first** (an MVP — the minimum useful version) instead of trying to build everything at once.

## Lessons learned (the short version)

- **Where files live matters** — pasting code into a chat isn't the same as putting it in your project.
- **Read the error message** — it usually names the exact problem.
- **Small syntax things break everything** — one missing pair of quotes cost me an hour.
- **Don't trust "it works"** — test it yourself, even when an AI says it's done.
- **Some problems are genuinely hard** — know when to use a workaround.
- **Cut the scope** — a small thing that works beats a big thing that doesn't.
- **Version control is a safety net** — it let me take risks and roll back.
- **Give AI small, specific jobs** — and review every change before accepting it.
- **Two AI products, two bills** — Claude Code is billed separately from the Claude.ai subscription.
