# Build Journal — ThaiBridge AI

This is the honest record of building **ThaiBridge AI**, my **first web app** — a Thai language and culture learning site — mostly with AI help, as a complete beginner. It's a learning project and a portfolio piece, not a finished product. I've kept the wins and the mistakes in, because the mistakes are where I actually learned.

## 19 July 2026 — Making developer login work on the live site

**Type:** Fix / Learning

**TL;DR**
- Fixed developer-mode login on the live site — it kept rejecting my password.
- Cause: Render had generated a *random* production password; my own one only worked locally.
- Switched the setup so a known, dashboard-set password works everywhere.

**What I built or did**
Got developer mode working on the live site. In `render.yaml` I switched `DEVELOPER_PASSWORD` from `generateValue: true` to `sync: false`, set my chosen password in the Render dashboard, and redeployed. Now the same password logs me in on the live site.

**Why I did it this way**
`generateValue: true` told Render to invent a random password, so login always failed there — while it worked locally because the app reads my `.env` file. `sync: false` (the same pattern I already use for Monk Mode codes) lets me set a known value in the dashboard that survives redeploys, without ever putting the secret in the public repo.

**How it works**
The app reads `DEVELOPER_PASSWORD` from the environment — locally from `.env`, and on the live site now from the Render dashboard value. Developer mode bypasses the paywall, so I can test gated sections like Tones & Consonant Classes.

**What this means for the app**
I can finally log into developer mode on the live site to check gated content — something I couldn't do before.

**What I learned**
Two things. First, "not updated in PyCharm" was a red herring — the code was fine; I was just hitting the new paywall (the gate doing its job). Second, order matters: set the dashboard value *before* switching to `sync: false`, or the live password briefly falls back to a guessable `"changeme"`.

## 19 July 2026 — Tones & Consonant Classes: built, consolidated, and gated

**Type:** Feature

**TL;DR**
- Built one section teaching consonant classes and tone rules together — because classes only exist to work out tones.
- Reused my existing quiz/XP scoring for four practice drills — no new system invented.
- Explored first and merged scattered content, folded in the old Grammar version, then gated the page behind the Basic tier (same as Grammar) and shipped it live.

**What I built or did**
A new "Tones & Consonant Classes" section: one data set, a `/tones-classes` page with reference tabs, and four progressive drills — class ID, tone calculation, contrast pairs, and the leading-ห rule. I started it on a feature branch (a separate copy of the project to work on safely), then consolidated: I moved the old "3-Tier Consonant Class System" out of the paid Grammar Guide into this one section (leaving a pointer link behind), added a same-sound consonant-pairs table and a "How to master this" study block, and added a Help-page note about learning tones early. Finally I put the whole page behind the Basic tier — the same paywall Grammar had.

**Why I did it this way**
Classes and tones belong together — you learn classes only to predict tones, so teaching them in two places was confusing. My tone content was scattered across three places, so I merged the best of it into one page. I first built it free, but since it now holds content that used to be paid (the Grammar consonant-class system), I gated it the same way as Grammar so I'm not giving away paid material.

**How it works**
The page reads from a single data dictionary. The drills send answers to my existing `/api/check_answer` endpoint, so points and levelling stay consistent. Access is gated like Grammar: **Basic tier, level 3, alphabet completed first**.

**How We Did It**
1. Searched `app.py`, data and templates for existing tone/class content.
2. Recommended merge vs rebuild, then waited for my approval.
3. Built the data, route, template and menu links, with four drills.
4. Merged the old Grammar consonant-class content in and removed the duplicate (left a pointer link).
5. Gated the page behind the Basic tier, then merged to `main` — it's now live.

**What this means for the app**
One clear place to learn tones and consonant classes, sitting properly inside the paid learning track instead of being duplicated across two pages.

**What I learned**
Exploring before editing paid off — I found content I'd otherwise have duplicated. And access level is a real decision: moving paid content into a "free" section quietly gives it away, so consolidation and pricing have to be thought through together.

## 18 July 2026 — Access model rework + Instant Access Pass, and Monk Mode goes live

**Type:** Milestone

**TL;DR**
- Reworked who pays for what: only the **Alphabet + Buddhism** section is free now; everything else needs a subscription *and* levelling up.
- Built the **Instant Access Pass** — an optional one-time £9.99 add-on that unlocks everything instantly.
- Tested it all and **went live** — Monk Mode and the new model are on the real site.

**What I built or did**
I shrank the free tier to just the alphabet and the Buddhism section, put the rest behind Basic (Buddhist Scholar) and Pro (Thai Master), and made Monk Mode waive only the payment — monks still level up. I added tier-name brackets (Free/Basic/Pro), gated two pages that were slipping through for free (Tour Guide, Business Thai), and built the Instant Access Pass: a one-time purchase that skips the level-and-alphabet grind.

**Why I did it this way**
I want the app to stay a fun learning challenge, so paying removes the paywall but never the levelling. The Pass is for people who'd rather skip the grind — an optional extra, not the default.

**How it works**
One access check runs three gates in order: alphabet, level, then payment. Monk Mode skips the payment gate; the Pass skips the alphabet and level gates. The Pass is a database flag set by a one-time Stripe payment, with a self-healing migration (adds any missing columns on startup).

**What this means for the app**
A clear, honest paid model with a generous free core — plus Monk Mode now live for the community.

**What I learned**
Testing caught what I couldn't see: two pages were free by accident, the pricing page still advertised now-paid content, and my local database was quietly missing columns. **The gate can be right while the label lies.** And going live taught me a hosting gotcha: a Blueprint-managed host treats its config file as the source of truth, so a variable added only in the dashboard gets wiped on the next deploy — the fix is to declare it in the config.

**How We Did It**
1. Tested the existing Monk Mode in the browser; fixed a see-through-navbar bug.
2. Set real Monk Mode access codes and stored them safely on the host.
3. Reworked the access rules: free = Alphabet + Buddhism, rest paid, Monk Mode free-but-still-levels.
4. Closed loose ends testing surfaced: ungated pages, stale pricing copy, a misleading progress page.
5. Added tier brackets and built the Instant Access Pass add-on end to end.
6. Verified with test scripts and a real Stripe test call, then merged to `main` and went live.
7. Hit a deploy gotcha — the host kept wiping the Monk Mode codes — and fixed it by declaring them in the Blueprint config so they persist.

## 16 July 2026 — Monk Mode: a free lesson track for monastics, plus a redesign start

**Type:** Feature

**TL;DR**
- Built **Monk Mode** — a free, code-gated lesson track for Buddhist monks, learnable both ways (Thai monks learning English, Western monks learning Thai).
- Drafted 10 monk-specific topics (140 items) — still to be reviewed.
- Started fixing the "boring long scroll" by rolling out the app's existing click-to-open sections.

**What I built or did**
Monk Mode: enter an access code to unlock a dedicated track of monastic lessons (alms round, precepts, daily routine…), each switchable between learning Thai and learning English with the right pronunciation help. I also turned several long pages (Theravada, Meditation, Gender) into collapsible sections. All on a safe `rebuild-experiment` branch (a separate copy to work on) — the live site was never touched.

**Why I did it this way**
One app, not two — the lessons already hold both languages, so a second app would just double the upkeep. I gated only the free *unlock* with a code, keeping the direction switch open to everyone. Paid value stays in the AI tutor, so giving content away doesn't dent revenue.

**How it works**
Monk lessons live as plain JSON files, one per topic, loaded when the app starts. A session setting holds the direction, and a small check lets Monk Mode skip the paywall. The redesign reuses an accordion the app *already had* — just applied to more pages.

**What this means for the app**
Monks and the wider community get genuinely useful, free lessons, and the long pages are far easier to navigate.

**What I learned**
Check what already exists before building — the accordion was already there. And match the audience: I switched the pronunciation help between IPA and plain respelling and back, learning the "right" choice depends entirely on who's reading.

**How We Did It**
1. Untangled two duplicate local copies and picked one clean folder.
2. Made a safe branch so the live site was never at risk.
3. Built Monk Mode in phases: free unlock → access-code gate → content track + direction switch.
4. Wrote and checked 10 lesson topics against the app's own romanization.
5. Found the app already had collapsible sections, and rolled them out to the long pages.
6. Committed and pushed each verified step.

## 8 July 2026 — Bringing the custom domain back online

**Type:** Bug Fix / Milestone

**TL;DR:**
- The branded link `thaibridge-ai.smoald.com` had stopped loading ("can't reach this page").
- The real cause wasn't the app — the subdomain had gone missing when `smoald.com` moved from Namecheap to Cloudflare.
- Rebuilt the DNS record on Cloudflare, re-added the custom domain in Render, and verified it live with a valid HTTPS padlock.

**What I built or did**
The pretty address for the app — `https://thaibridge-ai.smoald.com` — had stopped working. I traced it and found the subdomain simply didn't exist in DNS any more: when I moved `smoald.com` onto Cloudflare, the old subdomain record hadn't come across. I added a fresh record on Cloudflare (a CNAME pointing `thaibridge-ai` → `thaibridge-ai.onrender.com`), set to "DNS-only" so Render could still handle its own certificate, then re-added the custom domain inside Render. I also set the repo's Website link to the branded domain.

**Why I did it this way**
The app itself was never broken — only the address in front of it. So the fix belonged in DNS and hosting settings, not the code. Keeping the app on Render (which runs Flask apps as-is) and using Cloudflare only for the address gives the best of both: no rewrite, plus a professional `smoald.com` link.

**How it works**
A CNAME record is a signpost: it tells the internet "`thaibridge-ai.smoald.com` actually lives at `thaibridge-ai.onrender.com`." Render sees the matching custom domain on its side, issues a free HTTPS certificate, and serves the app. The old `onrender.com` address still works underneath as a fallback.

**What this means for the app**
The app is reachable again at a clean, branded address I can put on my CV and portfolio — with a valid HTTPS padlock. The link is permanent; it doesn't expire or need replacing.

**What I learned**
When a "site is down," it isn't always the app — this was pure DNS. I also learned that moving a domain between providers can silently drop subdomain records, so they need re-creating. And a small but important detail: with Cloudflare in front of Render, the DNS record must be "DNS-only" (grey cloud), or Render can't finish its certificate check.

## 10 June 2026 — Polishing the README into a case study and tidying the journal

**Type:** Documentation / Learning

**TL;DR:**
- Rebuilt the README as a portfolio case study, keeping the screenshots, badges and run steps.
- Reordered the whole journal into newest-first order without changing a word.
- Caught myself verifying against a stale local copy — a real lesson in checking the right source.

**What I built or did**
I reworked the README around a case-study narrative (problem, approach, proof) while keeping the screenshots, badges and run-it-locally steps a repo needs. I reordered JOURNAL.md into newest-first order and rebranded both files to ThaiBridge AI.

**Why I did it this way**
A case study tells recruiters a stronger story than a plain description, but a README must still show the app and how to run it — so I kept both. I reordered the journal rather than rewriting it, so no honest history was lost.

**How We Did It**
Compared the two READMEs → verified every number against the code → found my local `main` was 47 commits behind and re-verified against the real code → assembled the case study → reordered the journal with a script → proved the content was identical → renamed throughout.

**What this means for the app**
The repo now reads as a polished, honest portfolio piece: strong narrative, real screenshots, verified numbers, and a clean chronological build story.

**What I learned**
Check you're reading the live code, not a stale copy — I "corrected" right numbers into wrong ones until I synced. And reordering beats rewriting: you can tidy a journal without losing the honest record.

## 10 June 2026 — The rebuild experiment worked: merging it into `main`

**Type:** Milestone

**What I did**
**I merged my `rebuild-experiment` branch (a separate copy of the project I'd been working on safely) into `main`.** It had grown to 44 commits ahead — all the big recent work: real login, Stripe billing in £, the free/Pro AI tiers, the live deployment setup, and mobile fixes.

**Why**
The branch started as a sandbox to try a bigger redesign without risking the original. It's proven itself now, so it's earned its place as the main version.

**How it worked**
Because `main` had nothing new of its own, git did a clean **fast-forward** (it just slid `main` up to match the rebuild) — no conflicts. I checked afterwards: `main` now matches the rebuild exactly, at commit `31696b0`.

**What it means for the app**
`main` is the real, current version again. **The live site didn't change** — it still deploys from `rebuild-experiment`, so this was purely tidying up behind the scenes.

**What I learned**
Merging a long-running branch isn't scary when the target hasn't moved — it's a clean fast-forward. And "merge to main" and "what the server deploys" are two separate switches; I only flipped one.

## 10 June 2026 — Making ThaiBridge fit every phone and laptop

**Type:** Bug Fix / Learning

**TL;DR:**
- Made the whole app **responsive** — one link now adapts from a 320px phone to a desktop, so I don't need a separate mobile version.
- Fixed a sneaky **CSS specificity bug** that stopped sidebar pages collapsing to a single column on phones.
- Switched headings and the logo to **fluid sizing** and tidied the AI Tutor page on mobile.

**What I built or did**
On my iPhone, the sidebar pages were crushing content into a one-word-per-line strip, and the AI Tutor (chat) page had an oversized header plus tooltips poking off the screen. I made the layouts collapse to one column on phones, set the headings, logo and chat header to scale with screen width, and capped or hid the stray tooltips.

**Why I did it this way**
One responsive codebase beats a separate mobile app — half the upkeep and the two can't drift apart. Fluid `clamp()` sizing (a CSS rule that scales a value smoothly between a minimum and maximum) covers every screen width continuously instead of patching one phone size at a time.

**How We Did It**
Reproduced the breakage in a real browser at iPhone width → traced it to a CSS specificity clash → matched the mobile rules' specificity so they win → added fluid headings → shrank the chat header → ran an overflow audit across seven widths → fixed the last off-screen tooltips → confirmed zero sideways scroll on every page, with desktop unchanged.

**What this means for the app**
The whole site is now tidy and usable on any phone, tablet or laptop from the same link — much stronger when I show it to clients on a phone.

**What I learned**
CSS media queries add no specificity, so a more specific desktop rule beats a mobile one no matter the screen size — exactly why the layout refused to collapse. And measuring overflow across several real widths catches bugs that checking a single phone size hides completely.

## 9 June 2026 — Protecting the public AI demo's costs

**Type:** Decision / Learning

**TL;DR:**
- Raised the free AI limit from **5 to 15** messages per visitor so clients can properly try the tutor.
- Walled the public demo off with its **own Anthropic workspace key** (kill switch + separate tracking) and a **$7 hard spend cap**.
- Learned my account tier only offers an *org-wide* spend limit, not per-workspace — so I isolated by **key**, not by budget.

**What I built or did**
I gave the public demo its own Anthropic "ThaiBridge Demo" workspace and a dedicated API key, used only on Render, while my laptop keeps its old key. I set a $7 monthly spend cap with an email alert at ~$2, and raised `FREE_AI_DAILY_LIMIT` to 15.

**Why I did it this way**
A public AI link spends my real credits on every message. I wanted a hard ceiling so a bad day can't surprise me with a bill, and the demo isolated so abuse can't touch my own development work.

**How it works**
Three layers: cheap Haiku makes each message a fraction of a penny; the 15/day limit stops one person hogging it; the $7 cap is the wall nothing crosses. The separate key lets me revoke just the demo if it's abused, without breaking local dev.

**What I learned**
I assumed I could cap one workspace's spending — but on my tier, Anthropic only offers an *org-wide* spend limit; per-workspace limits are higher-tier. So I isolated by **key** (a kill switch and clean tracking) rather than by budget. And "free" messages aren't free to *me*: every message spends my credits — the limit caps the *count*, not the charge.

## 9 June 2026 — Putting ThaiBridge live, with a cost-safe AI link

**Type:** Milestone

**TL;DR:**
- Put ThaiBridge **live on the public internet** for the first time (Render free tier) — a clickable AI demo for my freelance portfolio.
- Made the public AI **cost-safe**: cheap Haiku model on the demo, a hard spend ceiling, and the `changeme` backdoor closed.
- Verified the live AI tutor end-to-end and kept the app warm with a free uptime pinger.

**What I built or did**
I deployed the `rebuild-experiment` branch to Render with a Blueprint (`render.yaml`), a Linux-safe build script and a pinned Python version, then made the repo public. The public demo runs the cheap Haiku model via an `AI_MODEL` environment variable, while local dev still uses Sonnet. I sent a real message to the live tutor, got a proper Thai answer back, and set UptimeRobot to ping the homepage every 5 minutes so it never sleeps.

**Why I did it this way**
A live, clickable AI app is far stronger portfolio proof than a private repo. Haiku plus a small prepaid balance with auto-reload off means the public demo can't run up my card.

**How We Did It**
Checked the app for tracked secrets → wrote the deploy files → smoke-tested the import → pushed and deployed → set a spend limit → switched the public model to Haiku via an env var → tested the live tutor → added the uptime pinger.

**What this means for the app**
ThaiBridge is now a fast, public, cost-protected demo I can put in front of clients.

**What I learned**
When the live app flickered with "no-server" errors, the Render logs showed it was just the free tier waking from sleep — not the memory crash I'd feared. Checking the logs beat guessing from outside. And for a public AI demo, "auto-reload off" is the *protective* setting, even though the dashboard nudges you to turn it on.

## 7 June 2026 — Making the Dhamma free, keeping the AI Pro

**Type:** Decision / Feature

**What I built or did**
I changed how the subscription tiers work so that the **Theravada Dhamma teachings** and the **meditation timer & techniques** are now completely free for everyone — no account, no subscription, no XP/level, and no "finish the alphabet first" gate. At the same time I kept the **AI Culture & Dhamma Q&A** as a Pro-only feature. I added the four "Coming soon" cards to the pricing page (Personalised Learning Path, Pronunciation Analysis, Listening Exercises, Writing Practice) as greyed-out, non-clickable placeholders, and wrote a short "freely given (dāna)" message on the Dhamma page, the meditation page, and the pricing page to explain the reasoning. While I was in there I also switched the whole app's pricing from dollars to **pounds (£9.99 / £19.99)** — both the displayed prices and the actual Stripe/PayPal charge currency (GBP), so they stay consistent.

**Why I did it this way**
It didn't sit right with me to lock the Buddha's teachings behind a paywall. I value generosity (*dāna*) — the teachings were freely given, so they should be free to read. But the AI features genuinely cost real money every time someone sends a message, so those make sense as a paid product. This gives the app a cleaner, more honest story: **Free** = read and learn everything; **Buddhist Scholar (£9.99)** = practise actively (2× XP, extended content); **Thai Master (£19.99)** = the AI works with you. I changed the charge currency to GBP at the same time so the £ I show isn't a lie about what actually gets billed.

**How it works**
There are two separate systems, and I was careful not to confuse them:
1. **Page access** is controlled by a `SECTION_REQUIREMENTS` dictionary in `app.py`. I changed `theravada` and `meditation` to `tier: 'free'`, `level: 1`, and `requires_alphabet: False`, so the access check always passes.
2. **AI chat modes** are gated separately in the `/api/ai/chat` route by a `FREE_AI_ALLOWED_MODES` set (just `tutor`). The Culture and Dhamma modes (their real internal ids are `cultural` and `buddhist`) were already excluded, so they stay Pro automatically. I left that logic untouched.
I also updated the tier feature lists so Free lists the teachings, Buddhist Scholar no longer does, and Thai Master names the AI Q&A perk — and changed `currency: 'usd'` → `'gbp'` (Stripe) and `"USD"` → `"GBP"` (PayPal).

**What this means for the app**
Anyone can now read the Dhamma and use the meditation timer for free, while the genuinely costly AI tools remain the thing people pay for. The pricing page explains *why*, which makes the offer feel honest rather than stingy, and prices are now shown in pounds to match me being UK-based.

**What I learned**
The big lesson was spotting that "the teachings" and "the AI about the teachings" are two completely different systems — page access vs. AI mode gating. I also learned to verify against the real code instead of trusting my own description: the AI modes were actually called `cultural` and `buddhist`, not `culture` and `dhamma`, and some pieces (the coming-soon cards) already existed. And changing a *displayed* price isn't enough — the billing currency lives separately in the Stripe and PayPal calls, so I had to change both or they'd disagree. I tested everything with Flask's test client before committing.

**References / Conversations**
Built in a Claude Code session on 7 June 2026. Tier/teaching changes committed as `ee1f507` on the `rebuild-experiment` branch; the £ currency switch followed.

## 6 June 2026 — Taking a real test payment with Stripe (and fixing a renewal-date bug)

**Type:** Milestone

**TL;DR:**
- Took my **first real test-card payment** through Stripe Checkout, end to end.
- Confirmed the webhook (Stripe's server messaging mine) flips the user to a paid plan in the database.
- Fixed a real bug: the subscription's renewal date wasn't being saved.

**What I built or did**
I set up local Stripe testing — the Stripe command-line tool and its webhook forwarder (which relays Stripe's "payment happened" messages to my app) — then paid with the test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`. It activated a real subscription in my database, with a genuine Stripe customer and subscription id attached.

**Why I did it this way**
The webhook is the trustworthy source of truth: a browser redirect can be faked, but a signed server-to-server message can't. Testing it locally proves the whole flow before going live.

**How We Did It**
Confirmed the right folder/branch → fixed an env-var name (`FLASK_SECRET_KEY`) that blocked startup → installed the `stripe` library and command-line tool → forwarded webhook events to `/stripe/webhook` → made a real test payment → verified the database flipped to paid → fixed the renewal-date bug → re-tested.

**What this means for the app**
Paid subscriptions now genuinely work and are safely recorded — the last blocker before going live.

**What I learned**
APIs change: Stripe moved the renewal date onto each subscription *item*, so my code was reading an empty field. The bigger lesson — **a "200 OK" doesn't prove it worked**; only checking the actual database caught both the missing date and the fact my browser first hit a stale tab.

## 6 June 2026 — Building the real subscription billing service (login, database-backed plans, premium page, freemium AI)

**Type:** Milestone

**TL;DR:**
- Replaced the fake "coming soon" login with **real accounts** (sign up, log in, log out).
- Built a **subscription billing service** where the **database is the source of truth**, not a cookie.
- Added a **premium/pricing page** and **gated the AI tutor** (free taste vs unlimited on Pro).

**What I built or did**
I turned the placeholder paywall into a real system. Real login/logout via Flask-Login (a toolkit that tracks "who is logged in"). Each user now stores their plan, status and Stripe ids in the database, with one rule (`effective_tier`) deciding what they can access. Checkout is tied to the logged-in user, and the Stripe webhook — not the browser — is the trusted thing that marks someone paid, renewed or cancelled. I wired checkout for **both Stripe and PayPal**, though only **Stripe is configured and verified so far** (PayPal is scaffolded for a later session). I merged the old feature showcase and pricing into one **Premium page**, and gated the **AI tutor**: free/basic get a daily taste (5 messages), Pro unlocks all modes unlimited.

**Why I did it this way**
A cookie can be faked; the database can't. Keeping the truth in the database (written only by the signed webhook) means a user can't just edit their browser to unlock Pro. Gating the AI fixed a mismatch — Pro advertised "premium AI" while everyone already got it free.

**How We Did It**
Added real login → added subscription fields to the User → tied checkout to the user → made the webhook the source of truth → enforced access from the database → merged the premium/pricing page → gated the AI tutor.

**What this means for the app**
The app now has a genuine, tamper-resistant freemium model: real accounts, plans stored safely, and paid features that are actually locked.

**What I learned**
"Source of truth" matters — deciding *one* place owns each fact (the database) removes a whole class of bugs and cheats. Keeping the access rule in one method (`effective_tier`) means every part of the app agrees on who gets what.

## 5 June 2026 — Finishing the wireframe layout, a clean rename, and shipping payments

**Type:** Milestone

**TL;DR:**
- Finished the Goal #1 frontend work: a proper **wireframe layout system** and a Help page.
- Settled the app's display name as **ThaiBridge AI** across the whole UI (the GitHub repo/handle stays `thaibridge-ai`).
- Bundled the now-complete **Stripe + PayPal** subscription payments.

**What I built or did**
I traced a startup crash ("unable to open database file") to a missing `instance/` folder and fixed it in one line, then cleaned up four broken CSS rules left from an earlier file move — the real cause of the "all over the place" look. I wrote a **content-first site outline** (the method from my web-design book: plan what each page says before styling it), which set out four page **wireframes** — *Landing*, *3-column content*, *Simple centered*, and *Full-width tool*. I then built the **3-column wireframe** (menu · content · extras) and rolled it out to the Learn, Culture and Buddhism pages using reusable partials (shared page-pieces), made tables fill-or-scroll at any zoom, added an `/instructions` Help page that explains the wireframe system to users, named the app **ThaiBridge AI** consistently across the UI, and shipped the finished Stripe + PayPal checkout.

**Why I did it this way**
I followed the **content-first outline → wireframe** method from my web-design book: decide what each page *does*, then give it the layout shape that fits — rather than forcing one layout on every page. Reusable partials mean editing one file, not fourteen. Using **ThaiBridge AI** as the display name while the GitHub repo/handle stays `thaibridge-ai` mirrors my own display-name-vs-handle approach (Joshua Kay / joshuablakemorekay).

**How We Did It**
Reproduced and fixed the database crash → balanced the broken CSS → wrote the content-first outline and its four wireframes → built shared sidebar/right-column partials and applied the 3-column wireframe page by page → fixed table overflow with a scroll wrapper → wrote the Help page → renamed across ~20 files → installed the missing payment library → committed and pushed.

**What this means for the app**
The learning pages now share one consistent, responsive wireframe, the name is consistent, and paid subscriptions work.

**What I learned**
A wireframe is a *planning* tool, not a feature — and each page wants the shape that fits its job. I also re-learned that a green tick and "200 OK" prove a page *loads*, not that it *looks right* (eight "broken" pages turned out to be working paywalls). And on this machine I must run the app with the project's **virtual-environment Python**, not the global one, or it crashes on a missing library.

## 5 June 2026 — Restructuring the frontend: site outline + shared wireframe (Goal #1)

**Type:** Milestone (in progress)

**TL;DR:** I reorganised the frontend in six small phases on the `rebuild-experiment` branch — but a visual check at the end showed the pages looking "all over the place," so this is a mid-fix checkpoint, not a finished job.

**What I built or did**
Moved the shared CSS and JS out of `base.html` into a new `static/` folder; added an optional wireframe layout (sidebar / main / right column), piloted on the Learn page; realigned the nav to a clean site outline; and added honest About, Contact and Privacy pages plus a "coming soon" login placeholder.

**Why I did it this way**
I followed the method from my web-design book — content-driven outline first, then a shared wireframe — and worked in tiny phases so each change was easy to check and to undo.

**How We Did It**
Tagged a restore point → extracted CSS → extracted JS → added empty wireframe blocks → filled them on one pilot page → realigned the nav → added the footer pages. After every phase I ran the app and the 32 tests, and committed each phase on its own.

**What this means for the app**
The code is much tidier and the structure now matches a real site map — but the layout still needs fixing before it's an improvement a user would actually feel.

**What I learned**
Passing tests and "200 OK" prove a page *loads*, not that it *looks right*. I only caught the mess by opening it in a browser — a reminder to trust my own eyes, not just green ticks.

**References / Conversations**
This Claude Code session; the full plan is saved as "Goal #1." Next step: diagnose the visual issue (likely the cramped Learn wireframe) or revert to the `pre-goal1` tag.

## 1 June 2026 — Archiving the verbatim build prompts as a tested library

**Type:** Milestone / Decision

**TL;DR:** I archived the *actual prompts* I used to build the app — word-for-word — into seven themed, automatically-tested folders in the prompt library, and merged them through my first proper pull request.

**What I built or did**
I turned the real build conversation into seven new prompt folders: `frontend-build`, `gamification-system`, `thai-alphabet-exercises`, `romanization-system`, `buddhist-pdf-integration`, `ai-tutor-integration`, and `claude-code-workflow`. Each one holds the verbatim prompt, my reasoning, an executable rubric, and a version history. The `romanization-system` folder documents my custom Paiboon+ vowel set (built on the system used by Benjawan Poomsan Becker, co-developed with my friend Douglas J. Alford, and still in active development).

**Why I did it this way**
My prompt library only held the two market-research prompts. Everything else — how I actually built the app — lived only in chat history, and the journal only *paraphrased* it. I wanted the library to hold my real, word-for-word prompts so it honestly reflects how the app was made.

**How We Did It**
Drafted the reasoning for each folder from my own words → reviewed each one → wrote the files → added a test fixture per prompt so the checks run for free → confirmed all nine prompts pass at 100% → put it through a feature branch and pull request (#1) and squash-merged it.

**What I learned**
A *paraphrased story* (the journal) and the *verbatim prompts* (the archive) are two different things, and both are worth keeping. This was my first real go at the branch-and-pull-request workflow I'd promised myself to adopt — and the green check before merging is exactly the payoff. I also hit two honest gotchas: a GitHub Action can't comment on a PR unless you explicitly grant it permission (it failed with a 403 until I fixed it), and a merge I *thought* had gone through actually hadn't — so I learned to verify a merge really landed before deleting the branch.

**References / Conversations**
This Claude Code session; pull request #1 on the `Thai-App-NEW` repo. Built using the prompt-archivist, commit-message and pr-description skills.

## 1 June 2026 — A prompt library, a tidier history, and documenting the codebase

**Type:** Milestone / Decision

**TL;DR:** I added a version-controlled prompt library and build journal to the repo, removed an outdated commit from history, and documented the whole codebase — deliberately using the right Claude tool for each job.

**What I built or did**
I brought a prompt library, an evaluation harness, a CI check and a new README into the repo (20 files), wrote a developer architecture guide from the real code, and cleaned up git history by removing one old, redundant commit.

**Why I did it this way**
I split the work by platform on purpose: **Claude.ai chat** for the human narrative (it can see my conversation transcripts), and **Claude Code** for the codebase docs and the git work (it can read my actual files). Right tool, right job.

**How We Did It**
Backed up the history with a tag → shelved unrelated changes → removed the old commit cleanly → extracted the archive → proved the prompt checks pass → wrote `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` from the real files → restored a dictionary file I'd deleted by accident.

**What I learned**
Rewriting *published* history needs a backup and a force-push — handle with care. And **don't trust a stray "exit 0"**: my prompt checks looked like they'd passed when they'd actually crashed, until I checked the real exit code.

**References / Conversations**

## March–April 2026 — Researching whether it's worth building

Before building more, I stopped to research the market: who the competitors are, how big the UK audience is, what people would pay, and whether there's a real gap.

**What I learned:** the gap is real — the big apps don't teach Thai at all, and none combine Thai with Buddhist culture. I also learned to *ground* research in real sources and to **check which tools actually ran** — I'd named a web-scraping tool and later found it never fired. (The prompts behind this research are saved in the `/prompts` folder.)

## February 2026 — Version control and a proper workflow

I set up Git (version control — a way to save snapshots of the project) and connected it to GitHub (online backup) one step at a time. Then I started using Claude Code (an AI that edits files in the project directly) for real tasks:

- Built a **user registration system** with a database and a signup form.
- Fixed a bug where empty forms could be submitted (used two safety layers — a browser check and a JavaScript check).
- Cleaned up the signup code and added **32 automatic tests** for the points/levels logic.
- Did a code review and fixed the important issues — including returning the correct error codes and stopping a database error from crashing the app.

**What I learned:** once Git was set up, I could make big changes — and let an AI make them — **without fear, because I could always roll back**. I also learned to give the AI small, specific jobs and review every change before accepting it. When Claude Code ran out of credits, I made two of the fixes by hand and understood what they did — which felt like a turning point.

## February 2026 — Adding Pra Kru Bob's Buddhist writings

I added two of Pra Kru Bob's Buddhist essays as new pages, keeping the wording faithful to the originals.

**What I learned:** my first attempt quietly dropped paragraphs. **Faithful means faithful** — I had to insist on the complete text and check it against the source rather than trust a summary.

## December 2025 — Adding the AI tutor

I connected the app to the Claude API (a way for the app to talk to the AI) to build an in-app tutor with several modes — conversation, grammar help, quizzes, culture, and Buddhism.

**What I learned:** this was the hardest setup. Python wasn't installed; then packages weren't installed; then my secret key vanished because I'd only set it for one terminal session; then it broke because I'd **forgotten the quote marks** around the key in Python. It finally worked once I loaded the key right at the top of the file. Biggest lesson: **don't trust "it works" — including from an AI.** I had to correct the claim that the chat worked when it didn't, and test it myself.

## December 2025 — The romanization display problem

Thai romanization uses accent marks, and one vowel combination (`ɔ̌ɔ`) kept rendering with mismatched letters. I tried several fixes — spacing, fonts, rendering tricks — and most didn't fully work.

**What I learned:** some problems are genuinely deeper than they look (this one is about how computers combine accent characters). I learned **when to stop polishing and pick a pragmatic workaround** rather than chase perfection.

## November 2025 — Building the first version (and debugging it)

I built the first working version: the Flask backend, the Thai alphabet and vocabulary content, lessons, a points-and-levels system, and the page styling.

**What I learned:** most of my early errors weren't broken code — they were **files in the wrong place**. "Template not found" meant a page wasn't in the folder Flask looks in. "name 'app' is not defined" meant I'd tried to *run* a file that was only meant to be *imported* into the main app. And two pages sharing the same web address crashed it. **Reading the error message** usually told me exactly what was wrong.

---

## November 2025 — Planning the app

I planned the app using a describe-then-check method: I told the AI exactly what I wanted (the format, the approach, how to work with me), then judged what came back and refined it.

**What I learned:** my plan ballooned into a huge, expensive vision. The real progress came from **cutting it down to a small, working version first** (an MVP — the minimum useful version) instead of trying to build everything at once.

---

## Lessons learned (the short version)

- **Where files live matters** — pasting code into a chat isn't the same as putting it in your project.
- **Read the error message** — it usually names the exact problem.
- **Small syntax things break everything** — one missing pair of quotes cost me an hour.
- **Don't trust "it works"** — test it yourself, even when an AI says it's done.
- **Some problems are genuinely hard** — know when to use a workaround.
- **Cut the scope** — a small thing that works beats a big thing that doesn't.
- **Version control is a safety net** — it let me take risks and roll back.
- **Give AI small, specific jobs** — and review every change before accepting it.
- **Two AI products, two bills** — Claude Code is billed separately from the Claude.ai subscription.
