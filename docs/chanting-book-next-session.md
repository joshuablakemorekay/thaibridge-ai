# Chanting book — next session

Paste-ready brief for picking this work up cold. Updated 2026-08-11 after pages
52, 53 and 54 went in.

## Read first, in this order

1. `docs/chanting-book-photo-map.md` — the brief, read it fully
2. `prompts/chanting-book-batch/README.md` — the two-stage workflow
3. `C:\Users\joshk\OneDrive\Documents\Documents\Digital Chanting Book\chanting-book-batch-prompts.pdf`
   — the Stage 1 and Stage 2 prompts. **Read it before any fresh page read.**

## State — verify with git, don't take this file's word

- **Pages 1–54 are in and unbroken**, plus 217–221. **81 chants, 1,083 verses.**
  `/chanting` derives that line itself, so it is never stale.
- 11 of the 17 pre-page chants are verified against their photographs.
- Pages 52, 53 and 54 were applied on 2026-08-11, one commit each; page 51
  landed the day before.

## How to work — this matters more than the tasks

**One page at a time.** Read the photograph, write the batch, apply it, show the
diff, commit, then **stop** and say the page is done. Ask before pushing and
before any commit to `main`. No `Co-Authored-By` trailer.

A page can hold more than one chant, and often three. **Read the whole page
before deciding what it contains** — page 30 was expected to be Pabbatopama
alone and turned out to hold the end of one chant, a brand-new one, and the
start of a third.

## Next: page 55, `IMG_0318`

It continues **สังฆาภิคีติ**, whose first four lines are at the foot of page 54.
Verse 4 there ends with a full stop, but that is not the chant ending: both of
the other two hymns run past their fourth line into a **two-column half** read
across the row, and the contents puts the next entry at page ๕๕. So expect
verse 5 onward in two columns, and expect the hymn to close the way the other
two did — a bow-down rubric, then four lines of กาเยนะ วาจายะ… asking pardon.

**Pages 52–54 are one shape repeated three times**, once for each of the Triple
Gem, and page 55 should be the tail of the third:

  rubric → the recollection as run-on prose (พระพุทธคุณ / พระธรรมคุณ /
  พระสังฆคุณ) → rubric → the abhigīti hymn, four long centred lines then a
  two-column half → bow-down rubric → four lines of pardon.

Two things that shape brought up, and both will recur on 55:

- **None of these chants has a printed title.** The rubric above each one names
  it, and that is where every id and English title in this stretch came from.
- **Each hymn's invitation is printed INSIDE the rubric**, not as a line of its
  own. It is kept in the page block and the `invitation` field is left empty, so
  the page prints it once. Keep doing that unless Josh says otherwise.

Pages 222 and 223 sit beside 217–221 which are already in, so they are a cheap
excursion whenever wanted.

## A rubric printed inside a chant goes on the VERSE

Pages 53 and 54 both print หมอบลงพร้อมกัน… between verse 14 and verse 15 of a
hymn. A page block cannot go there — `build_page_index` can only put blocks
between whole chants — so it rides on verse 14 as `'rubric'`, which the template
renders under that line. Same mechanism as page 1's (กราบพร้อมกัน).

`apply_batch` carries a verse `rubric` through, so declare it on the verse in
the batch file and it lands. Do not try to force it into `batch.pages.blocks`.

## The tooling, and what it will and won't do

`check_batch.py` then `apply_batch.py --dry-run` then apply. Both need
`PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` on Windows or they die on the first Thai character.

Three kinds of entry:

- **new** — a chant not in the app. Appended.
- **continuation** — `continuation_of`, bringing later verses of a chant already
  started. Carries on the verse numbering; never restarts at 1.
- **merge** — `merge_only: true`, for a chant already in the app in full. Brings
  `page_start`, `book_number`, `layout`, `source_printed`, a `closing`,
  `corrections` and `page_markers`, and **no verses**.

`corrections` overwrite text already in the app and are matched on the whole
literal, required to appear exactly once inside that chant, or they raise and
write nothing. `page_markers` record where a printed page turns inside a chant
already in the file — **without one, every verse lands on `page_start`** and the
page shows far more than the book prints. That was missed once already, on
Saccapāna verse 11.

### Then `check_pages.py`, which is the one that answers Josh's question

`scripts/check_pages.py` reconciles EVERY batch file against the app: does each
page show the chants, the verses and the blocks its photograph recorded, with
the same text. It is the third check, and the only one that asks whether the app
page matches the printed page — `check_batch` checks a batch against itself and
`apply_batch` only writes. Run it after every page. It also runs as a test
(`tests/test_check_pages.py`), so a page going out of step with its photograph
breaks the suite instead of waiting to be noticed.

It knows one rule worth knowing yourself: a line cut by a page break belongs to
the page it STARTS on, and the completed line must begin with the partial one.
The `english` layer is exempt from that prefix test — the gloss of half a
sentence is not the start of the gloss of the whole one.

## Three things waiting on Josh — ask, don't guess

**สวากขาโต, and which mark goes over the ส.** Page 51 prints it TWICE with a
mark above the ส, and at high magnification that mark is the same shape as the
thanthakhat in ประดิษฐ์ four lines above it, in the same face and size — so page
51 was read as **ส์วากขาโต**. The app now holds this one word three ways:
plain `สวากขาโต` (page 1, and the page-1 นมัสการ), `ส์วากขาโต` and `ส๎วากขาโต`.
Two of the three must be wrong. One look at the book settles the whole word
everywhere, and it is a chanted line, so it is worth doing early.

Pages 52–53 widened it from one word to a **class**. The same small mark turns
up over the ล of กัล์ยาโณ, the ธ of พุทธ์วา, the ส of พุทธัสสาหัส์มิ and the ส of
ส์วากขาตะตา — and the app already holds the first of those the other way, as
กัล๎ยาณัง with U+0E4E in `buddhabhithuti`. So the question is not "which mark on
this word" but **which of the two marks this book's printer uses**, U+0E4C
(thanthakhat ์) or U+0E4E (yamakkan ๎). One answer fixes every one of them, and
they are all chanted lines. Everything entered on pages 51–54 uses ์.

**The ฬ/พ hazard.** These photographs cannot tell ฬ from พ at body-text size.
Proven twice against Josh's own readings from the book: page 23 line 19, and
อะสัมมุฬโห on page 22. Words written with ฬ as a **judgement, not a reading**:

- อะวิรุฬหิฉันทา — page 22
- ปีฬิตัสสะ — page 24
- วาฬะมิคานิ — page 29

**And the one that matters most.** Paṭiccasamuppāda writes the sense-bases word
as สะพายะตะนัง with พ at verses 4, 5, 16 and 17, and the photograph appears to
agree. Standard Pali is *saḷāyatana*, with ฬ. Josh's instruction to "let the
photo win" was given for paste damage and **must not be applied here** — the
photograph is precisely what cannot settle this, and applying it would fix four
wrong readings permanently. Left untouched pending the book.

## Eight chants still print their colophon as a chanted verse

A closing formula — `<title> นิฏฐิตา.` — is printed as a centred colophon, and
the app has a `closing` field that renders it that way. Twenty-eight chants use
it. But **eight of the pre-page chants hold that line as their last VERSE**, so
the app numbers it and lists it as though it were chanted:

Tilakkhaṇādi (p27), Devatābhisammantana (p27), Mettānisaṃsasutta (p22),
Mettānisaṃsagāthā (p23), Pabbatopama (p30), Ariyadhana (p31), Buddhaudāna (p32),
Bhaddekaratta (p33).

Devatādissa was the ninth and is fixed — `IMG_0288.PNG` shows its colophon set
exactly like the one above it, which the app already held as a `closing`. The
other eight were left alone deliberately: their pages are on the "to verify"
list in the photo map, and **the page is the only thing that can say which page
the colophon is printed on.** Pabbatopama proves why — page 30 runs its verses
to the very foot, so its colophon is on page 31, and the app currently shows it
on 30. Fix them as each page is read, not in a sweep.

## Settled — do not re-open

- Page 23 line 19 is **วิรุฬหะ** (Josh, against the physical book).
- Variant readings **do** get a field; it exists as of `b40c9c5`.
- **Pages 5 and 21 are on both the index and the contents**, as of `a97326d`
  and `169777f`. An earlier version of this file said their absence was "not a
  fault and settled". That was wrong and Josh was right to push back: the
  *book* names neither, because both are pages a chant continues onto rather
  than starts on — but the *app* could still reach them, and now does. A chant
  card shows every page it runs across (`pages 4–5`, `pages 20–22`), and a
  contents line offers a button for every page in its stretch.
- **`/chanting` states its coverage** — "Pages 1–31 and 217–221 are in so far",
  as runs rather than a count, because a count reads as a continuous range.

## Things learned the hard way, worth not relearning

- **A new chant is appended to the end of `CHANTS`**, so it lands at the foot of
  its page whatever its number. Down-page order is now settled by the book's own
  chant numbering where every chant on a page has one — but nothing orders the
  unnumbered ones, so check a multi-chant page renders top to bottom correctly.
- **A pre-page chant's `source` may cite the wrong chant entirely.**
  Pabbatopama's named page 30's two footnotes, which belong to the two chants
  above it. Suspect any `source` naming more than one reference.
- **Not every missing chant is one of the seventeen.** Ādiyasutta, numbered 13,
  had simply never been entered, between two chants that were both already in.
- **A Render deploy usually takes about a minute but has taken 15.** Check with
  `render deploys list srv-d8k5ucm7r5hc738qhcb0 -o json --confirm` rather than
  polling the live page and guessing.
- **The English of a reprinted text is copied from the earlier printing**, not
  written again. The evening service reprints a great deal of the morning one,
  and two glosses of the same Pali that differ in wording read as two different
  lines. Pages 52 and 54 take their English straight from the app's pages 2 and
  3 wherever the Pali matches, and note in a check where it does not.

## Two faults in the tooling, neither fixed

Both are cosmetic, both are in `apply_batch.py`, and both are worth knowing
before they mislead someone.

- **`# ‼ COMPLETED FROM p?`** — the page number is written as a literal `?`. The
  code reads `verse.get('page', '?')`, but a completing verse correctly has no
  `page` key: the line belongs to the page it STARTS on, which is the earlier
  one. So the comment loses the one fact it exists to record. Four entries have
  it, from pages 35, 41, 47 and 52; only the hand-written p7 one is right.
- **The `CONTINUES markers: n -> n` report is counted too early.** Page 53's run
  printed `1 -> 0` while correctly leaving a fresh marker on `dhammabhigiti`.
  The file was right and the report was wrong. Grep the file rather than trust
  that line.
